# Vehicle In/Out Detection and Count Project

Welcome to the Vehicle In/Out Detection and Count Project by DinjanAI! This project showcases the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) techniques for accurately detecting and counting vehicles entering and exiting a specified area.

## Overview
This project aims to provide a robust solution for monitoring vehicle movement, particularly in scenarios such as parking lots, traffic intersections, or toll booths. By leveraging AI, ML, and DL algorithms, the system can effectively identify vehicles, track their movement, and provide real-time counts of incoming and outgoing traffic.

## Features
- Detection and recognition of vehicles entering and exiting a designated area
- Real-time tracking of vehicle movement
- Accurate counting of vehicles in both directions
- Integration with existing surveillance systems
- Customizable configurations for different environments

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Various deep learning models (e.g., YOLO, SSD)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/DinjanAI/Vehicle_Detection_Count.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download pre-trained models for object detection (e.g., YOLO, SSD) from the respective sources and place them in the appropriate directories within the project.

## Usage
1. Run the main script to start the vehicle in/out detection system:

```
python vehicle_counting.py
```

2. Adjust the parameters and configurations as needed for your specific environment and requirements.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to contribute to this project, please follow these steps:
1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/YourFeature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/YourFeature`)
